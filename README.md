# Adaboost Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the Adaboost algorithm as part of a homework assignment for the course DLF21 (Deep Learning Fundamentals 21).

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of the Adaboost algorithm, a powerful ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners to produce a strong learner. The notebook includes the steps to preprocess the data, implement the Adaboost algorithm, and evaluate its performance.
